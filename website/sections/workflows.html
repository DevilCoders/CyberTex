    <h2>Design auditable, end-to-end security operations</h2>
    <p>
      SAPL workflows codify organisational knowledge. Blend automation with human approvals
      to deliver consistent playbooks across detection, response, and proactive testing.

      <h3>Prototype rapidly</h3>
      <p>
        Iterate in <code>sapl shell</code> with live data. Use watch mode to reload plugins when
        underlying Python modules change.
      </p>

    <div class="timeline__item">
      <h3>Validate collaboratively</h3>
      <p>
        Run <code>sapl inspect --json</code> to produce machine readable manifests. Teams review
        diffs inline and sign off on guardrails before production rollout.

      <h3>Operationalise safely</h3>
      <p>
        Deploy workflows with scheduled runs or event driven triggers. Every invocation is
        logged, immutable, and exportable to SIEM platforms.

    <h3>Documentation as a service</h3>
    <p>
      Publish the advanced website to give stakeholders a live view into workflows, controls,
      and escalation paths. QR codes embedded in runbooks link to the exact section on this
      site, streamlining audits and post-incident reviews.
