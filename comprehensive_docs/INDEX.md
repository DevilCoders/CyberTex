- [Runtime Semantics](RUNTIME_SEMANTICS.md): Low-level explanation of how the interpreter evaluates programs, manages frames, and coordinates async execution.
- [Plugin Architecture](PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md): Guidance for building, packaging, and distributing reusable extensions.
- [Workflow Playbooks](WORKFLOWS.md): End-to-end recipes for research teams deploying SAPL in collaborative environments.
- [Website Overview](WEBSITE_OVERVIEW.md): Documentation for the bundled advanced website, its structure, and deployment recommendations.
- [Embedded Assets](../docs/EMBEDDED_ASSETS.md): Field manual for the `EMBED` statement, metadata conventions, and packaging workflows.
- [Embedded Language Catalog](../docs/EMBED_LANGUAGE_CATALOG.md): Canonical list of supported languages and extension guidance.
- [Full-Stack Website Workflows](../docs/FULLSTACK_WEBSITES.md): Blueprint-to-preview guidance for running security-focused web apps end-to-end.

All documents are designed to be read together, with cross-references that explain how concepts connect across the toolchain.
